🌐 MundoVoice — Multilingual Voice Translator & Voice Cloner

MundoVoice is an AI-powered speech tool that can:

 -Transcribe your voice to text
 -Translate it into another language
 -Generate speech in the target language
 -Clone your own voice (supported via ElevenLabs — optional with premium API)

This project helps bridge language barriers while keeping your identity and tone.
It can be used for:

**Integrating with WhatsApp to automatically process and translate voice messages**
Speaking with foreign friends while still sounding like yourself
Cross-language content creation and voice messaging
Multilingual assistant/chat systems
WhatsApp automation & voice cloning aren't activated here due to premium and API requirements, but both can be integrated easily using ElevenLabs + WhatsApp API or third-party automation tools (Twilio, Meta Business API, etc.).
